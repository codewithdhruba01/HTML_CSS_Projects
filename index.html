                <u><h2>Early life and Education</h2></u>
                <p><b>Mark Elliot Zuckerberg was born on May 14, 1984,</b> in White Plains,
                     New York to psychiatrist Karen (n√©e Kempner) and dentist Edward Zuckerberg.
                      He and his three sisters (Arielle, Randi, and Donna) were raised in a Reform Jewish household
                       in Dobbs Ferry, New York. His great-grandparents were emigrants from Austria, Germany, and Poland. 
                       Zuckerberg initially attended Ardsley High School before transferring to Phillips Exeter Academy.

                <h3><b>Early years</b></h3>
                <p>Zuckerberg learned computer programming in his childhood. At about the age of eleven, he created "ZuckNet", a program that allowed computers at the family home and his father's dental office to communicate with each other.[8] During Zuckerberg's high-school years, he worked to build a music player called the Synapse Media Player. The device used machine learning to learn the user's listening habits, which was posted to Slashdot[9] and received a rating of 3 out of 5 from PC Magazine.[10] The New Yorker once said of Zuckerberg, "some kids played computer games. Mark created them."[4] While still in high school, he attended Mercy College taking a graduate computer course on Thursday evenings.[4]
